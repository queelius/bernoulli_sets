# Literature Context (Post-Revision)

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Paper**: Bernoulli sets

## Summary

The literature context is largely unchanged from the 2026-02-26 initial review. Key updates:

1. **Warner (1965) now cited**: The most significant missing reference from the previous review has been added. The paper now correctly acknowledges that the per-element model is Warner's randomized response.

2. **Shannon (1948) now prominent**: The BSC connection is explicitly discussed in Remark 3.1 and the conclusion, with Shannon cited.

3. **Encrypted search references orphaned**: With the removal of the Boolean search section, the Song/Wagner/Perrig (2000), Curtmola et al. (2006), and Cash et al. (2013) references are no longer cited.

## Positioning

The paper is now well-positioned relative to the literature:

- **Below the framework** (per-element models): BSC (Shannon 1948), randomized response (Warner 1965) -- both cited
- **At the same level** (probabilistic data structures): Bloom filters (Bloom 1970), cuckoo filters (Fan 2014), xor filters (Graf & Lemire 2020), etc. -- all cited via Broder & Mitzenmacher survey
- **Above the framework** (the contribution): Compositional algebra of approximate sets -- this is the paper's novelty

## Still Missing (Optional)

- Tarkoma et al. (2012) "Theory and Practice of Bloom Filters for Distributed Systems" -- a more recent survey
- Goutte & Gaussier (2005) -- distributional analysis of precision/recall (related to Section 4)
- Pagh et al. (2005) -- "An optimal Bloom filter replacement" (related to space bounds)

These are optional enhancements; the bibliography is adequate as-is for a journal submission.

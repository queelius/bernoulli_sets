## Citation Accuracy

All 22 actively cited references have been verified:

| Key | Author/Year | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| bf | Bloom (1970) | Correct |
| phf | Towell (undated) | @Unpublished, no access info |
| shs | Towell (undated) | @Unpublished, no access info |

## Post-Revision Changes

1. **Warner (1965) added**: Now cited in Remark 3.1 and the conclusion. This was the most significant missing reference from the previous review.
2. **Shannon (1948) properly cited**: Referenced in BSC remark and conclusion.
3. **Ribbon filter venue**: Now correctly listed as arXiv preprint (was previously flagged as potentially incorrect).
4. **Citation spacing**: All active sections use `~\cite{}` convention.

## Issues

1. **Orphaned entries**: 3 entries (songWagnerPerrig, curtmola, cashDynamic) are no longer cited. These should be removed from references.bib.
2. **Self-citations**: phf and shs still have only "Working paper. Available from the author upon request." No URLs or preprint links provided.
3. **Companion work**: The conclusion references three companion papers but provides no citations.

## Overall: Citation integrity is good. Three orphaned entries should be cleaned up.
